                           Gilded Rose Refactoring Solution
                              ðŸŽ¯ Solution Overview

I've refactored the Gilded Rose inventory management system using Scala to create a maintainable, extensible solution while preserving all original functionality and adding support for "Conjured" items. The solution replaces complex conditional logic with a polymorphic design that follows SOLID principle

ðŸ§  Key Design Decisions
1. Polymorphic Item Handling


Created an ItemUpdater trait to define update behavior

Implemented specific update logic for each item type:

NormalItem: Standard degradation

AgedBrie: Quality increases over time

Sulfuras: Immutable legendary item

BackstagePass: Special concert-ticket behavior

ConjuredItem: Degrades twice as fast (new requirement)


### ðŸ§© Polymorphic Item Handling
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[updateQuality] --> B{Item Type}
    B -->|Normal| C[NormalItem]
    B -->|Aged Brie| D[AgedBrie]
    B -->|Sulfuras| E[Sulfuras]
    B -->|Backstage| F[BackstagePass]
    B -->|Conjured| G[ConjuredItem]
    C --> H[Apply Rules]
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    ðŸš€ Benefits of This Approach
Extensibility: Add new item types in 3 simple steps:

Create new ItemUpdater implementation

Add to getUpdater matcher

Write test cases

Readability: Each item's logic is self-contained

Maintainability: Changes to one item type don't affect others

Testability: Each handler can be tested in isolation

Preserved Compatibility: Original Item class remains unchanged
