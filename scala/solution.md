                           Gilded Rose Refactoring Solution
                              ðŸŽ¯ Solution Overview

I've refactored the Gilded Rose inventory management system using Scala to create a maintainable, extensible solution while preserving all original functionality and adding support for "Conjured" items. The solution replaces complex conditional logic with a polymorphic design that follows SOLID principle

ðŸ§  Key Design Decisions
1. Polymorphic Item Handling


Created an ItemUpdater trait to define update behavior

Implemented specific update logic for each item type:

NormalItem: Standard degradation

AgedBrie: Quality increases over time

Sulfuras: Immutable legendary item

BackstagePass: Special concert-ticket behavior

ConjuredItem: Degrades twice as fast (new requirement)


graph TD
    A[GildedRose] --> B[updateQuality]
    B --> C[Loop through items]
    C --> D[getUpdater]
    D -->|Item Type| E[NormalItem]
    D -->|Aged Brie| F[AgedBrie]
    D -->|Sulfuras| G[Sulfuras]
    D -->|Backstage Pass| H[BackstagePass]
    D -->|Conjured*| I[ConjuredItem]
    E --> J[Update Logic]
    F --> J
    G --> J
    H --> J
    I --> J

    ðŸš€ Benefits of This Approach
Extensibility: Add new item types in 3 simple steps:

Create new ItemUpdater implementation

Add to getUpdater matcher

Write test cases

Readability: Each item's logic is self-contained

Maintainability: Changes to one item type don't affect others

Testability: Each handler can be tested in isolation

Preserved Compatibility: Original Item class remains unchanged
